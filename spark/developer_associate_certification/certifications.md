## What does it cover?

To get a general overview of the certification exam, check this page in the [Databricks Academy](https://academy.databricks.com/exam/databricks-certified-associate-developer). As stated in the site, the exam assesses "an understanding of [the basics of the Spark architecture](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html) and the ability to apply the [Spark DataFrame API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html) to complete individual data manipulation tasks". For more details, please read through the page carefully.

## Why should you do it?
Here are a few reason, why I feel that you should give it a try:

- If you have worked with Spark a little bit and feel like continue working with it, the certificate preparation will give you broader knowledge and more confidence
- If you are in a tech lead position and needs to advice teams on aspect of Spark programming, the preparation will enable you to give more nuanced opinion
- If in your current work, there is very little opportunity to work Spark, but you can feel that the situation may change in future, the certification will put you in the front seat when that happens
- If you have little or no working experience, wants to work in the area of machine learning and big data engineering, etc., achieving a certification is a good way to grab attention in the job market
- If you have experience in different area of IT, wants to migrate internally in the above mentioned area internally, achieving a certification will make the case stronger

On a small, but important note, the exam costs very little and most of the preparation material and technology are widely available. So, if you have the time and you agree with the above or other convinving arguments, why not?
